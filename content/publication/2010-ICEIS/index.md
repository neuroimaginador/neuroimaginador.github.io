abstract: 'Moodle is one of the most extended LMS. Moodle allows the collaborative
  learning where students and teachers collaborate on the daily work. But problems
  with Moodle arise in our scientific context. Although Moodle can preview LaTeX code,
  not all the possibilities of LaTeX are available and it is very good for scientific
  teachers but hard for students, so, the mathematical formulas are usually replaced
  by non-standard versions of them written in ASCII. Another problem with Moodle is
  the difficulty of reusing quizzes. We present two tools that improve Moodle in three
  aspects: representation of math formulas, mathematical computation, and improving
  the learning units for the students. WIRIS is a powerful editor and allows interacting
  by using mathematic formulas in an easy way and developing new learning units with
  mathematical computation via web; M-QIT is a new tool able to manage and reutilize
  quizzes and questions available in previous courses in Moodle.'
