abstract: We present a new neural model, which extends Kohonen's self-organizing map
  (SOM) by performing a Probabilistic Principal Components Analysis (PPCA) at each
  neuron. Several self-organizing maps have been proposed in the literature to capture
  the local principal subspaces, but our approach offers a probabilistic model at
  each neuron while it has linear complexity on the dimensionality of the input space.
  This allows to process very high dimensional data to obtain reliable estimations
  of the local probability densities which are based on the PPCA framework. Experimental
  results are presented, which show the map formation capabilities of the proposal
  with high dimensional data. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.
