abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of artificial neural networks in order
  to solve the Shortest Common Superstring Problem. Concretely, the neural network
  used in this work is based on a multivalued model, MREM, very suitable for solving
  combinatorial optimization problems. We describe the foundations of this neural
  model, and how it can be implemented in the context of this problem, by taking advantage
  of a better representation than in other models, which, in turn, contributes to
  ease the computational dynamics of the model. Experimental results prove that our
  model outperforms other heuristic approaches known from the specialized literature.
