abstract: In this work a new algorithm to improve the performance of optimization
  methods, by means of avoiding certain local optima, is described. Its theoretical
  bases are presented in a rigorous, but intuitive, way. It has been applied concretely
  to the case of recurrent neural networks, in particular to MREM, a multivalued recurrent
  model, that has proved to obtain very good results when dealing with NP-complete
  combinatorial optimization problems. In order to show its efficiency, the well-known
  MaxCut problem for graphs has been selected as benchmark. Our proposal outperforms
  other specialized and powerful techniques, as shown by simulations.
