abstract: 'An extension to Hopfield''s model of associative memory is studied in the
  present work. In particular, this paper is focused in giving solutions to the two
  main problems present in the model: the apparition of spurious patterns in the learning
  phase (implying the well-known and undesirable effect of storing the opposite pattern)
  and the problem of its reduced capacity (the probability of error in the retrieving
  phase increases as the number of stored patterns grows). In this work, a method
  to avoid spurious patterns is presented and studied, and an explanation to the previously
  mentioned effect is given. Another novel technique to increase the capacity of a
  network is proposed here, based on the idea of using several reference points when
  storing patterns. It is studied in depth, and an explicit formula for the capacity
  of the network is provided. This formula shows the linear dependence of the capacity
  of the new model on the number of reference points, implying the increase of the
  capacity in mis model. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.'
