abstract: We present a nonparametric probability density estimation model. The classical
  Parzen window approach builds a spherical Gaussian density around every input sample.
  Our method has a first stage where hard neighbourhoods are determined for every
  sample. Then soft clusters are considered to merge the information coming from several
  hard neighbourhoods. Our proposal estimates the local principal directions to yield
  a specific Gaussian mixture component for each soft cluster. This leads to outperform
  other proposals where local parameter selection is not allowed and/or there are
  no smoothing strategies, like the manifold Parzen windows. © Springer-Verlag Berlin
