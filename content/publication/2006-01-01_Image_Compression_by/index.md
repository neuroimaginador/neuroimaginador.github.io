abstract: In this work we propose a recurrent multivalued network, generalizing Hopfield's
  model, which can be interpreted as a vector quantifier. We explain the model and
  establish a relation between vector quantization and sum-of-squares clustering.
  To test the efficiency of this model as vector quantifier, we apply this new technique
  to image compression. Two well-known images are used as benchmark, allowing us to
  compare our model to standard competitive learning. In our simulations, our new
  technique clearly outperforms the classical algorithm for vector quantization, achieving
  not only a better distortion rate, but even reducing drastically the computational
  time. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.
