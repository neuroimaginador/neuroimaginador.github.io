  abstract = {A method to estimate the probability density function of multivariate distributions is presented. The classical Parzen window approach builds a spherical Gaussian density around every input sample. This choice of the kernel density yields poor robustness for real input datasets. We use multivariate Student-t distributions in order to improve the adaptation capability of the model. Our method has a first stage where hard neighbourhoods are determined for every sample. Then soft clusters are considered to merge the information coming from several hard neighbourhoods. Hence, a specific mixture component is learned for each soft cluster. This leads to outperform other proposals where the local kernel is not as robust and/or there are no smoothing strategies, like the manifold Parzen windows.
