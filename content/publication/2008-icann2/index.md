abstract: A method to estimate the probability density function of multivariate distributions
  is presented. The classical Parzen window approach builds a spherical Gaussian density
  around every input sample. This choice of the kernel density yields poor robustness
  for real input datasets. We use multivariate Student-t distributions in order to
  improve the adaptation capability of the model. Our method has a first stage where
  hard neighbourhoods are determined for every sample. Then soft clusters are considered
  to merge the information coming from several hard neighbourhoods. Hence, a specific
  mixture component is learned for each soft cluster. This leads to outperform other
  proposals where the local kernel is not as robust and/or there are no smoothing
  strategies, like the manifold Parzen windows. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
