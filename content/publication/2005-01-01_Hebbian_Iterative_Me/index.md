abstract: 'In this paper, two important issues concerning pattern recognition by neural
  networks are studied: a new model of hebbian learning, as well as the effect of
  the network capacity when retrieving patterns and performing clustering tasks. Particularly,
  an explanation of the energy function when the capacity is exceeded: the limitation
  in pattern storage implies that similar patterns are going to be identified by the
  network, therefore forming different clusters. This ability can be translated as
  an unsupervised learning of pattern clusters, with one major advantage over most
  clustering algorithms: the number of data classes is automatically learned, as confirmed
  by the experiments. Two methods to reinforce learning are proposed to improve the
  quality of the clustering, by enhancing the learning of patterns relationships.
  As a related issue, a study on the net capacity, depending on the number of neurons
  and possible outputs, is presented, and some interesting conclusions are commented.'
