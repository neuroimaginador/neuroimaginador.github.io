abstract: This work proposes an unsupervised competitive neural network based on adaptive
  neighborhoods for video segmentation and object detection. The designed neural network
  is proposed to form a background model based on subtraction approach. The synaptic
  weights and the adaptive neighborhood of the neurons serve as a model of the background
  and are updated to reflect the statistics of the background. The segmentation performance
  of the proposed neural network is examined and compared to mixture of Gaussian models.
  The proposed algorithm is parallelized on a pixel level and designed to enable efficient
  hardware implementation to achieve real-time processing at great frame rates. Â©
