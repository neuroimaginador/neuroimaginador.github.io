abstract: 'In this work, the well-known Graph Partitioning (GP) problem for undirected
  weighted graphs has been studied from two points of view: maximizing (MaxCut) or
  minimizing (MinCut) the cost of the cut induced in the graph by the partition. An
  unified model, based on a neural technique for optimization problems, has been applied
  to these two concrete problems. A detailed description of the model is presented,
  and the technique to minimize an energy function, that measures the goodness of
  solutions, is fully described. Some techniques to escape from local optima are presented
  as well. It has proved to be a very competitive and efficient algorithm, in terms
  of quality of solutions and computational time, when compared to the state-of-the-art
  methods. Some simulation results are presented in this paper, to show the comparative
  efficiency of the methods.'
