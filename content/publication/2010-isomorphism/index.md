abstract: A lot of methods have been proposed for the kinematic chain isomorphism
  problem. However, the tool is still needed in building intelligent systems for product
  design and manufacturing. In this paper, we design a novel multivalued neural network
  that enables a simplified formulation of the graph isomorphism problem. In order
  to improve the performance of the model, an additional constraint on the degree
  of paired vertices is imposed. The resulting discrete neural algorithm converges
  rapidly under any set of initial conditions and does not need parameter tuning.
  Simulation results show that the proposed multivalued neural network performs better
  than other recently presented approaches.
