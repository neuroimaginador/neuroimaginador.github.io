abstract: In this work we have reviewed the concepts of Learning Managementystem (LMS), Learning Content Management System (LCMS) and Content Management System (CMS). Their main features are studied, and a comparison among them is presented, along with a summary of some well- known integrations between LMS and CMS. Another important point in this work is presenting HECACEJ, a B-learning tool designed to create static content in Joomla! This tool is a specific content manager for publishing the material for a subject, which does not need help from the administration menu of Joomla! (difficult to use by a non-expert professor) and is able to publish these contents in Joomla! main menu. This tool eases the publication of B- learning contents (class notes, past exams, professors' data, etc.) in a static web page that can be accessed from the main menu of the platform Joomla!, which provides facilities for manipulating the contents but it was not developed ad- hoc for our proposal.
