abstract: Detection of isomorphism among kinematic chains is essential in mechanical
  design, but difficult and computationally expensive. It has been shown that both
  traditional methods and previously presented neural networks still have a lot to
  be desired in aspects such as simplifying procedure of identification and adapting
  automatic computation. Therefore, a new algorithm based on a competitive Hopfield
  network is developed for automatic computation in the kinematic chain isomorphism
  problem. The neural approach provides directly interpretable solutions and does
  not demand tuning of parameters. We have tested the algorithm by solving problems
  reported in the recent mechanical literature. Simulation results show the effectiveness
  of the network that rapidly identifies isomorphic kinematic chains.
