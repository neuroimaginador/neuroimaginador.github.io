abstract: This paper present a video segmentation method which separate pixels corresponding
  to foreground from those corresponding to background. The proposed background model
  consists of a competitive neural network based on dipoles, which is used to classify
  the pixels as background or foreground. Using this kind of neural networks permits
  an easy hardware implementation to achieve a real time processing with good results.
  The dipolar representation is designed to deal with the problem of estimating the
  directionality of data. Experimental results are provided by using the standard
  PETS dataset and compared with the mixture of Gaussians and background subtraction
  methods. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.
