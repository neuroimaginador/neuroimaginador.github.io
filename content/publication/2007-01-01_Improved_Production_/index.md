abstract: In this work, a general framework for developing learning rules with an
  added term (perturbation term) is presented. Many learning rules commonly cited
  in the specialized literature can be derived from this general framework. This framework
  allows us to introduce some knowledge about vector quantization (as an optimization
  problem) in the distortion function in order to derive a new learning rule that
  uses that information to avoid certain local minima of the distortion function,
  leading to better performance than classical models. Computational experiments in
  image compression show that our proposed rule, derived from this general framework,
  can achieve better results than simple competitive learning and other models, with
  codebooks of less distortion. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.
