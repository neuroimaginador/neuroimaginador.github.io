abstract: 'This paper performs a complete study on performance and energy efficiency
  of biomedical codes when accelerated on GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). We have
  selected a benchmark composed of three different building blocks which constitute
  the pillars of four popular biomedical applications: Q-norm, for the quantile normalization
  of gene expressions, reg f3d, for the registration of 3D images within the NiftyReg
  library, bedpostx (from the FSL neuroimaging package) and a multi-tensor tractography
  for the analysis of diffusion images. We try to identify (1) potential scenarios
  where performance per watt can be optimal in large-scale biomedical applications,
  and (2) the ideal GPU platform among a wide range of models, including low power
  Tegras, popular GeForces and high-end Titans. Experimental results conclude that
  data locality and arithmetic intensity represent the most rewarding ways on the
  road to high performance bioinformatics when power is a major concern.'
