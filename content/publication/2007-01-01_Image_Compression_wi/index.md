abstract: Image compression techniques have required much attention from the neural
  networks community for the last years. In this work we intend to develop a new algorithm
  to perform image compression based on adding some pre-fixed prototypes to those
  obtained by a competitive neural network. Prototypes are selected to get a better
  representation of the compressed image, improving the computational time needed
  to encode the image and decreasing the code-book storage necessities of the standard
  approach. This new method has been tested with some well-known images and results
  proved that our proposal outperforms classical methods in terms of maximizing peak-signal-to-noise-ratio
  values. © 2007 International Federation for Information Processing.
