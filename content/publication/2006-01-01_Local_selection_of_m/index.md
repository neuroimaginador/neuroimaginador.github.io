abstract: Here we present a novel probability density estimation model. The classical
  Parzen window approach builds a spherical Gaussian density around every input sample.
  Our proposal selects a Gaussian specifically tuned for each sample, with an automated
  estimation of the local intrinsic dimensionality of the embedded manifold and the
  local noise variance. This leads to outperform other proposals where local parameter
  selection is not allowed, like the manifold Parzen windows. © Springer-Verlag Berlin
