abstract: In this paper, the K-pages graph layout problem is solved by a new neural
  model. This model consists of two neural networks performing jointly in order to
  minimize the same energy function. The neural technique applied to this problem
  allows to reduce the energy function by changing outputs from both networks -outputs
  of first network representing location of nodes in the nodes line, while the outputs
  of the second one meaning the page where the edges are drawn. A detailed description
  of the model is presented, and the technique to minimize an energy function is fully
  described. It has proved to be a very competitive and efficient algorithm, in terms
  of quality of solutions and computational time, when compared to the state-of-the-art
  heuristic methods specifically designed for this problem. Some simulation results
  are presented in this paper, to show the comparative efficiency of the methods.
