abstract: The aim of this work is to present a segmentation method to detect moving
  objects in video scenes, based on the use of a multivalued discrete neural network
  to improve the results obtained by an underlying segmentation algorithm. Specifically,
  the multivalued neural model (MREM) is used to detect and correct some of the deficiencies
  and errors off the well-known Mixture of Gaussians algorithm. Experimental results,
  using video scenes publicly available from the Internet, show an increase of the
  visual quality of the segmentation, that could improve for subsequent analysis phases,
  such as object tracking or behavior studies.
