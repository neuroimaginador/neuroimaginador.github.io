abstract: 'We present a work developed by a group of teachers in the Department of
  Applied Mathematics at the University of Malaga. Since 2002, FERMAT1 Project has
  become an important meeting point between teachers and students for the subjects
  of Numerical Methods, Algebra, Calculus, Vectorial Analysis, Differential Equations
  and Discrete Mathematics in the degree of Telecommunication Engineering. Our main
  goal was the development of an educational environment complementary to the classical
  model of teaching, in order to get a gradual adaptation to the European Space for
  Higher Education (ESHE) according to Bologna Declaration. Our method consists on
  theoretical lessons using multimedia technologies and also practical sessions in
  the laboratories. In these sessions the students solve practical problems with the
  aid of the computer. On the other hand, we offer access to the resources in our
  website (class notes, proposed and solved problems...), an also to on-line resources:
  mail, forum, chat, videoconference... In a first step we create FERMAT website including
  some resources that can be useful for students. The suggestions of these students
  have been helpful for the development of the last version, named FNOVA2. Thanks
  to these suggestions we have introduced important improvements in this version of
  our new tool3. These are those that we present in this paper.'
