abstract: 'We present a work developed by a group of teachers in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Malaga. Since 2002, FERMAT Project has  become an important meeting point between teachers and students for the subjects  of Numerical Methods, Algebra, Calculus, Vectorial Analysis, Differential Equations  and Discrete Mathematics in the degree of Telecommunication Engineering. Our main  goal was the development of an educational environment complementary to the classical  model of teaching, in order to get a gradual adaptation to the European Space for  Higher Education (ESHE) according to Bologna Declaration. Our method consists on  theoretical lessons using multimedia technologies and also practical sessions in  the laboratories. In these sessions the students solve practical problems with the  aid of the computer. On the other hand, we offer access to the resources in our  website (class notes, proposed and solved problems...), an also to on-line resources:  mail, forum, chat, videoconference... In a first step we create FERMAT website including  some resources that can be useful for students. The suggestions of these students  have been helpful for the development of the last version, named FNOVA. Thanks  to these suggestions we have introduced important improvements in this version of our new tool. These are those that we present in this paper.'
