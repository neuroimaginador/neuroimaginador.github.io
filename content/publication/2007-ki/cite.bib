  abstract = {In this work, a new stochastic method for optimization problems is developed. Its theoretical bases guaranteeing the convergence of the method to a minimum of the objective function are presented, by using quite general hypotheses. Its application to recurrent discrete neural networks is also developed, focusing in the multivalued MREM model, a generalization of Hopfield's. In order to test the efficiency of this new method, we study the well-known Traveling Salesman Problem. Experimental results will show that this new model outperforms other techniques, achieving better results, even on average, than other methods. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},
