abstract: In this work, a new stochastic method for optimization problems is developed.
  Its theoretical bases guaranteeing the convergence of the method to a minimum of
  the objective function are presented, by using quite general hypotheses. Its application
  to recurrent discrete neural networks is also developed, focusing in the multivalued
  MREM model, a generalization of Hopfield's. In order to test the efficiency of this
  new method, we study the well-known Traveling Salesman Problem. Experimental results
  will show that this new model outperforms other techniques, achieving better results,
  even on average, than other methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.
