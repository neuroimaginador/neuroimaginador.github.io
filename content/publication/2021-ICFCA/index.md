abstract: FCA exhaustively uses the notion of cluster by grouping attributes and objects
  and providing a solid algebraic structure to them through the concept lattice. Our
  proposal explores how we can cluster implications.  This work opens a research line
  to study the knowledge inside the clusters computed from the Duquenne-Guigues basis.
  Some alternative measures to induce the clusters are analysed, taking into account
  the information that directly appears in the appearance  and the semantics of the
  implications.  This work also allows us to show the fcaR package,   which has the
  main methods of FCA and the Simplification Logic.  The paper ends with a motivation
  of the potential applications of performing clustering on the implications.
