abstract: The map-coloring problem is a well known combinatorial optimization problem
  which frequently appears in mathematics, graph theory and artificial intelligence.
  This paper presents a study into the performance of some binary Hopfield networks
  with discrete dynamics for this classic problem. A number of instances have been
  simulated to demonstrate that only the proposed binary model provides optimal solutions.
  In addition, for large-scale maps an algorithm is presented to improve the local
  minima of the network by solving gradually growing submaps of the considered map.
  Simulation results for several n-region 4-color maps showed that the proposed neural
  algorithm converged to a correct colouring from at least 90% of initial states without
  the fine-tuning of parameters required in another Hopfield models. © Springer-Verlag
