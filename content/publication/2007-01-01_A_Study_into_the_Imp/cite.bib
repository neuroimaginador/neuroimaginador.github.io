  abstract = {The map-coloring problem is a well known combinatorial optimization problem which frequently appears in mathematics, graph theory and artificial intelligence. This paper presents a study into the performance of some binary Hopfield networks with discrete dynamics for this classic problem. A number of instances have been simulated to demonstrate that only the proposed binary model provides optimal solutions. In addition, for large-scale maps an algorithm is presented to improve the local minima of the network by solving gradually growing submaps of the considered map. Simulation results for several n-region 4-color maps showed that the proposed neural algorithm converged to a correct colouring from at least 90% of initial states without the fine-tuning of parameters required in another Hopfield models.
