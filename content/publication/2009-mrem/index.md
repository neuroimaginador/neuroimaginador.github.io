abstract: Since McCulloch and Pitts’ seminal work (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943), several
  models of discrete neural networks have been proposed, many of them presenting the
  ability of assigning a discrete value (other than unipolar or bipolar) to the output
  of a single neuron. These models have focused on a wide variety of applications.
  One of the most important models was developed by J. Hopfield in (Hopfield, 1982),
  which has been successfully applied in fields such as pattern and image recognition
  and reconstruction (Sun et al., 1995), design of analogdigital circuits (Tank &
  Hopfield, 1986), and, above all, in combinatorial optimization (Hopfield & Tank,
  1985) (Takefuji, 1992) (Takefuji & Wang, 1996), among others. The purpose of this
  work is to review some applications of multivalued neural models to combinatorial
  optimization problems, focusing specifically on the neural model MREM, since it
  includes many of the multivalued models in the specialized literature.
