abstract: We present a neural model which extends classical competitive learning by
  performing a Probabilistic Principal Components Analysis at each neuron. In the
  learning process is utilized a competition rule which try to get the better representation
  of the dataset while maintaining the homogeneity of the formed clusters. The model
  also has the ability to learn the number of basis vectors required to represent
  the principal directions of each cluster, so it overcomes a drawback of most local
  PCA models, where the dimensionality of a cluster must be fixed a priori.
