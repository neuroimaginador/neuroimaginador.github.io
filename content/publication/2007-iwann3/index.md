abstract: In this work, we propose the use of two neural models performing jointly
  in order to minimize the same energy function. This model is focused on obtaining
  good solutions for the two pages book crossing problem, although some others problems
  can be efficiently solved by the same model. The neural technique applied to this
  problem allows to reduce the energy function by changing outputs from both networks
  -outputs of first network representing location of nodes in the nodes line, while
  the outputs of the second one meaning the half-plane where the edges are drawn.
  Detailed description of the model is presented, and the technique to minimize an
  energy function is fully described. It has proved to be a very competitive and efficient
  algorithm, in terms of quality of solutions and computational time, when compared
  to the state-of-the-art methods. Some simulation results are presented in this paper,
  to show the comparative efficiency of the methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
